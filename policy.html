    <h2>About our return policy</h2>
    <br><br>
    <p class="textP">
    If you're not happy with your purchase you can send any unworn item/items back 
    to us FREE of charge within 100 days of the delivery date.
    Items tried on to see whether they fit are not considered used, 
    but we reserve the right to refuse a return due to damage, or upon grounds of hygiene.
    If a return is refused for either of these reasons, the item will be returned to you from
    our warehouse and the refund will not be issued. This does not affect your statutory rights.
